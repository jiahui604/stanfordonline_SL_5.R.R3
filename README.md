Bootstrapping for linear regression to estimate beta_hat's standard error

Q:
Now, use the (standard) bootstrap to estimate s.e.(Î²^1). To within 10%, what do you get?

The question asks within 10% actually is an answer validation box which will check your estimated value with 90% (1-10%) confidence interval, so try to type in values such as 0.027 or 0.0258 to get the idea.
